The spirit pursued by the blockchain industry and practitioners is also freedom, pursuit, uniqueness, and courage.",

The wisdom of information dissemination is the quality conveyed to us by the blue whale, and KingData also takes this quality as its corporate spirit to efficiently disseminate effective industry information and data for the majority of users.",
    backgroundTip: "This time, the KingData BlueWhale Award will start with 6 major categories. They are the NFT Emerging List, GameFi Emerging List, DAO Emerging List, Infrastructure Emerging List, Public Chain Emerging List, and DEX Emerging List.

    backgroundTips: "One of the objectives of this is to summarize the market for investors to help them find better investment targets and industry trends.
