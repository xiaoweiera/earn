Don’t worry, below you will find a list of decentralized DeFi protocols and platforms that do no have any token yet and  could potentially introduce one in the future. We think it could be worth to interact with them to increase your chances to be eligible for a potential retroactive DeFi airdrop.<br/><br/>Please note: It’s pure speculation if any of those platforms listed below will introduce their own governance or how they are going to distribute it. So there is no guarantee to receive anything. In the worst case you waste some transactions fees, but in the best case you’ll receive a free airdrop.",
